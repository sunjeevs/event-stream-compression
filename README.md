# Event-Stream-Compression-for-Neuromorphic-Vision-Grid-DBSCAN-and-Voxelization
Code for event-stream compression (grid top-k, DBSCAN, voxelization) in neuromorphic vision. Unified pipeline for N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, and N-Caltech101 with HDF5 storage. Benchmarks ConvGRU and SNN; scripts to reproduce metrics, training curves, confusion matrices, and ROC.
